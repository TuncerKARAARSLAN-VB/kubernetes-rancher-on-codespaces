# Git Remote

To add a remote repository in Git, you use the `git remote add` command. A **remote** is a version of your project thatâ€™s hosted on a server, allowing you to collaborate with others.

## Syntax

```bash
git remote add <name> <url>
```

- `<name>`: The short name for the remote repository (usually `origin` for the main remote).
- `<url>`: The URL of the remote repository (for example, a GitHub repository URL).

## Example

1. If you have a GitHub repository with the following URL:
   `https://github.com/username/project.git`

2. To add it as a remote with the name `origin`, you would run:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/project.git
   ```

3. To check if the remote was added successfully, use:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   You should see:

   ```bash
   origin  https://github.com/username/project.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/username/project.git (push)
   ```

## Using the Remote

After adding the remote, you can push changes to it using the following command:

```bash
git push origin <branch>
```

For example:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This pushes the local `main` branch to the `origin` remote repository.
