# Markdown List

Below is a list of common Markdown commands with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## 1. Headers

Headers are used to define sections and subsections in your document. Markdown supports six levels of headers.

**Syntax:**

- Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, `###` for H3, and so on up to `######` for H6.
- Add a space after the `#` symbol.

**Example:**

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

**Rendered Output:**

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

**Explanation:**  
This example shows how to create headers of different sizes. Header 1 is the largest, and Header 6 is the smallest.

## 2. Emphasis

You can emphasize text by making it bold or italic.

**Syntax:**

- For **bold**, wrap the text in double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`).
- For *italic*, wrap the text in single asterisks (`*`) or single underscores (`_`).

**Example:**

```markdown
**This is bold text**
*This is italic text*
__This is also bold text__
_This is also italic text_
```

**Rendered Output:**

**This is bold text**  
*This is italic text*  
__This is also bold text__  
_This is also italic text_

**Explanation:**  
This shows how to emphasize text. You can use either asterisks or underscores for the same effect.

## 3. Lists

### Unordered Lists

Use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens to create unordered lists.

**Example:**

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Subitem 2.1
  * Subitem 2.2
* Item 3
```

**Rendered Output:**

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3

**Explanation:**  
This creates a simple unordered list with subitems under Item 2.

### Ordered Lists

Use numbers followed by a period to create ordered lists.

**Example:**

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2
3. Third item
```

**Rendered Output:**

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2
3. Third item

**Explanation:**  
This shows an ordered list with subitems, where the order is significant.

## 4. Links

You can create hyperlinks in Markdown.

**Syntax:**

- Use `[link text](URL)`.

**Example:**

```markdown
[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
```

**Explanation:**  
This creates a clickable link with "OpenAI" as the text that directs to the specified URL.

## 5. Images

Images can also be included using a similar syntax to links.

**Syntax:**

- Use `![alt text](image URL)`.

**Example:**

```markdown
![OpenAI Logo](https://openai.com/favicon.ico)
```

**Rendered Output:**

![OpenAI Logo](https://openai.com/favicon.ico)

**Explanation:**  
This shows how to embed an image. The "alt text" is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.

---

## 6. Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to denote quoted text.

**Syntax:**

- Start the line with `>`.

**Example:**

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

**Rendered Output:**

> This is a blockquote.

**Explanation:**  
This indicates that the text is a quote. You can also nest blockquotes by adding additional `>` characters.

## 7. Code

You can format code snippets in Markdown.

**Syntax:**

- For inline code, wrap the text in backticks (`` ` ``).
- For block code, use triple backticks (```` ``` ````) before and after the code block.

**Example:**

```markdown
Here is some inline code: `console.log('Hello, World!')`.

```
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
}
```
```

**Rendered Output:**

Here is some inline code: `console.log('Hello, World!')`.

```
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This shows how to include inline and block code snippets, useful for programming examples.

**Syntax:**

- Use three or more dashes (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`).

**Example:**
