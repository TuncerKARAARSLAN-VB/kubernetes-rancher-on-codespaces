# What is Multi-Tenancy?

**Multi-tenancy** is an architectural approach that allows multiple users, applications, or services to operate in isolation on the same physical infrastructure. In the context of Kubernetes, multi-tenancy refers to the ability for multiple applications or user groups to utilize the same resources within a cluster while ensuring that these resources are securely and effectively isolated.

## Multi-Tenancy in Kubernetes

Kubernetes offers various mechanisms to enable multi-tenancy features. With these mechanisms, different applications or user groups can control their access to each other's resources while running within the same Kubernetes cluster. Here are some key components of this approach and how they work:

### 1. **Namespaces**

- **Definition**: Kubernetes uses the concept of **namespaces** to group resources. Each namespace creates a logical space for a specific application or user group.

- **Purpose**: To isolate the resources of different applications or users. For instance, if two different projects are running in the same Kubernetes cluster, separate namespaces can be created for each to ensure resource separation.

- **Usage**: All Kubernetes resources created within a namespace (such as Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) are only visible to users belonging to that namespace. This prevents users from accessing resources belonging to other applications.

### 2. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

- **Definition**: RBAC is a method used in Kubernetes to manage access control to resources. It defines which resources a user or service account can access by assigning specific roles.

- **Purpose**: To limit users or applications' access only to the resources they need. For example, a user might have access only to Pods within a specific namespace, while another user cannot access resources in other namespaces.

- **Usage**: With RBAC, a specific role can be created (e.g., a role with read-only permissions), and this role is assigned to certain users or groups. This way, users can access only the resources they are authorized for.

### 3. **Network Policies**

- **Definition**: Network policies are a mechanism that controls the network traffic between Pods. It defines which Pod can access which other Pods.

- **Purpose**: To ensure secure communication between applications and support the isolation of resources. For example, Pods in one namespace can be restricted from accessing Pods in another namespace.

- **Usage**: A network policy created within a specific namespace can allow traffic only from certain IP addresses or specific Pods.

### 4. **Resource Quotas**

- **Definition**: Resource quotas are a mechanism used to limit the resources (CPU, memory, etc.) that can be utilized within a namespace.

- **Purpose**: To ensure fair distribution of resources among different users or applications and to prevent excessive resource consumption.

- **Usage**: A specific amount of CPU and memory can be allocated for a namespace. For instance, if a project is limited to 4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory, the Pods associated with that project cannot exceed this limit.

## Example Scenario

Let's say a company wants to run two different applications (for instance, an e-commerce site and an internal communication tool) in the same Kubernetes cluster. Below is a scenario of how these applications can be managed using multi-tenancy:

1. **Creating Namespaces**:
   - A namespace called `ecommerce` is created for the e-commerce application.
   - Another namespace called `communication` is created for the communication tool.

2. **Access Control with RBAC**:
   - The e-commerce team is granted access only to the `ecommerce` namespace.
   - The communication tool team is granted access only to the `communication` namespace.

3. **Communication Control with Network Policies**:
   - Pods in the `ecommerce` namespace are allowed to access only other Pods within that namespace. Pods in the `communication` namespace cannot access them.

4. **Resource Management with Resource Quotas**:
   - Pods in the `ecommerce` namespace are limited to 8 CPUs and 16 GB of memory.
   - Pods in the `communication` namespace are limited to 4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory.

## Conclusion

Multi-tenancy enables effective management of resources in Kubernetes while isolating applications from each other. This allows different applications or user groups sharing the same physical infrastructure to operate securely and efficiently. Mechanisms like **Namespaces**, **RBAC**, **Network Policies**, and **Resource Quotas** are fundamental components of the multi-tenancy approach, providing essential structures for applications and users within a Kubernetes cluster.
