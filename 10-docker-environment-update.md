# Initial Setup of Codespace Environment

When you first open a Codespace environment, it's crucial to ensure that your package manager is up to date. Running the following commands will help keep your system secure and stable:

## Step 1: Update Package Lists

Use the command below to refresh your package database, allowing your system to know about the latest available packages and their versions:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

- **What it does:** This command updates the list of packages in your repositories. It does not install or upgrade any packages yet but prepares the system for that action.

## Step 2: Upgrade Installed Packages

After updating the package list, you should upgrade any outdated packages using:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

- **What it does:** This command installs the latest versions of all packages currently installed on your system. It ensures that any security vulnerabilities and bugs are patched, enhancing system stability and performance.

## Why It Matters

1. **Security:** Keeping your packages updated minimizes security risks by ensuring you have the latest security patches.
2. **Stability:** Upgrading packages reduces the likelihood of bugs and compatibility issues with new software you might install later.
3. **Access to New Features:** Upgraded packages often include new features and improvements that can enhance your development experience.

## Conclusion

Running `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt upgrade` is a simple yet effective practice to maintain your Codespace environment. Always remember to perform these steps whenever you start a new session to ensure a smooth and secure development experience.
