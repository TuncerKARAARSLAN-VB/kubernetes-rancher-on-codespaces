In Kubernetes, a DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a specific Pod runs on all (or a subset of) nodes in the cluster. This is useful for running background tasks such as log collection, monitoring, or managing storage on each node. Below is a list of common `kubectl` commands related to DaemonSets, along with their descriptions:

### Common `kubectl` Commands for DaemonSets

1. **List DaemonSets**
   ```bash
   kubectl get daemonsets
   ```
   - Lists all DaemonSets in the current namespace.

2. **Describe a DaemonSet**
   ```bash
   kubectl describe daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Provides detailed information about a specific DaemonSet, including its Pods, configuration, and events.

3. **Create a DaemonSet from a YAML File**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <daemonset-definition.yaml>
   ```
   - Creates a DaemonSet using the configuration defined in a YAML file.

4. **Delete a DaemonSet**
   ```bash
   kubectl delete daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Deletes a specified DaemonSet.

5. **Get DaemonSet YAML/JSON**
   ```bash
   kubectl get daemonset <daemonset-name> -o yaml
   ```
   - Retrieves the DaemonSet configuration in YAML format.

   ```bash
   kubectl get daemonset <daemonset-name> -o json
   ```
   - Retrieves the DaemonSet configuration in JSON format.

6. **Get Pods Managed by a DaemonSet**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l name=<daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Lists all Pods managed by a specific DaemonSet, using labels to filter.

7. **Get Events Related to a DaemonSet**
   ```bash
   kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=<daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Displays events related to a specific DaemonSet, which can help in troubleshooting issues.

8. **Edit a DaemonSet**
   ```bash
   kubectl edit daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Opens the DaemonSet configuration in your default text editor for inline editing.

9. **Rollout a DaemonSet**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Shows the rollout status of a DaemonSet.

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Displays the rollout history of a DaemonSet.

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Undoes the last rollout of a DaemonSet.

### Example of DaemonSet Creation

Hereâ€™s an example of how to create a DaemonSet using a YAML file:

1. **Create a DaemonSet YAML file (e.g., `my-daemonset.yaml`)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: DaemonSet
   metadata:
     name: my-daemonset
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         name: my-daemonset
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           name: my-daemonset
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: my-container
           image: my-image:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

2. **Apply the DaemonSet**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f my-daemonset.yaml
   ```

### Summary

These commands provide a comprehensive toolkit for managing DaemonSets in Kubernetes. DaemonSets are essential for ensuring that specific workloads run on every node, making them ideal for services like monitoring, logging, and network services.
