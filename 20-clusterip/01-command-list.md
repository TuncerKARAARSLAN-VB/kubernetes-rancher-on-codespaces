In Kubernetes, a ClusterIP is a type of Service that provides a stable IP address for Pods and is only accessible within the cluster. Below is a list of common `kubectl` commands related to ClusterIP Services, along with their descriptions:

### Common `kubectl` Commands for ClusterIP Services

1. **List ClusterIP Services**
   ```bash
   kubectl get services --field-selector spec.type=ClusterIP
   ```
   - Lists all Services of type ClusterIP in the current namespace.

2. **Describe a ClusterIP Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl describe service <service-name>
   ```
   - Provides detailed information about a specific ClusterIP Service, including its endpoints and configuration.

3. **Create a ClusterIP Service from a YAML File**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <service-definition.yaml>
   ```
   - Creates a ClusterIP Service using the configuration defined in a YAML file.

4. **Delete a ClusterIP Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl delete service <service-name>
   ```
   - Deletes a specified ClusterIP Service.

5. **Get ClusterIP Service YAML/JSON**
   ```bash
   kubectl get service <service-name> -o yaml
   ```
   - Retrieves the Service configuration in YAML format.

   ```bash
   kubectl get service <service-name> -o json
   ```
   - Retrieves the Service configuration in JSON format.

6. **Edit a ClusterIP Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl edit service <service-name>
   ```
   - Opens the Service configuration in your default text editor for inline editing.

7. **Get Endpoints of a ClusterIP Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
   ```
   - Displays the endpoints that the ClusterIP Service is routing traffic to.

8. **Get Events Related to a ClusterIP Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=<service-name>
   ```
   - Displays events related to a specific Service, which can help in troubleshooting issues.

### Example of ClusterIP Service Creation

Hereâ€™s an example of how to create a ClusterIP Service using a YAML file:

1. **Create a Service YAML file (e.g., `my-service.yaml`)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-clusterip-service
   spec:
     type: ClusterIP
     selector:
       app: my-app
     ports:
       - port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
   ```

2. **Apply the Service**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f my-service.yaml
   ```
