In Kubernetes, a NodePort is a type of Service that exposes an application on a static port on each Node's IP address. This allows external traffic to access the Service via the Node's IP address and the specified NodePort. Below is a list of common `kubectl` commands related to NodePort Services, along with their descriptions:

### Common `kubectl` Commands for NodePort Services

1. **List NodePort Services**
   ```bash
   kubectl get services --field-selector spec.type=NodePort
   ```
   - Lists all Services of type NodePort in the current namespace.

2. **Describe a NodePort Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl describe service <service-name>
   ```
   - Provides detailed information about a specific NodePort Service, including its configuration and endpoints.

3. **Create a NodePort Service from a YAML File**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <service-definition.yaml>
   ```
   - Creates a NodePort Service using the configuration defined in a YAML file.

4. **Delete a NodePort Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl delete service <service-name>
   ```
   - Deletes a specified NodePort Service.

5. **Get NodePort Service YAML/JSON**
   ```bash
   kubectl get service <service-name> -o yaml
   ```
   - Retrieves the Service configuration in YAML format.

   ```bash
   kubectl get service <service-name> -o json
   ```
   - Retrieves the Service configuration in JSON format.

6. **Edit a NodePort Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl edit service <service-name>
   ```
   - Opens the Service configuration in your default text editor for inline editing.

7. **Get Endpoints of a NodePort Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
   ```
   - Displays the endpoints that the NodePort Service is routing traffic to.

8. **Get Events Related to a NodePort Service**
   ```bash
   kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=<service-name>
   ```
   - Displays events related to a specific Service, which can help in troubleshooting issues.

### Example of NodePort Service Creation

Hereâ€™s an example of how to create a NodePort Service using a YAML file:

1. **Create a Service YAML file (e.g., `my-nodeport-service.yaml`)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-nodeport-service
   spec:
     type: NodePort
     selector:
       app: my-app
     ports:
       - port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
         nodePort: 30000  # Optional: Specify a custom NodePort
   ```

2. **Apply the Service**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f my-nodeport-service.yaml
   ```

### Summary

These commands provide a comprehensive toolkit for managing NodePort Services in Kubernetes. NodePort Services are essential for allowing external traffic to access applications running in the cluster, making them useful for development, testing, and specific production scenarios.
