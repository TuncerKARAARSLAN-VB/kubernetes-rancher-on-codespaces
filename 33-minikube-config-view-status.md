To read the memory and CPU count of your running Minikube instance, you can use the following commands:

### 1. **Check Memory and CPU Usage with `minikube status`:**
The `minikube status` command provides the overall status of your Minikube instance, but it does not show memory or CPU allocation directly. Instead, use the next command.

### 2. **Check Minikube Configuration:**
To see the memory and CPU settings for Minikube, use the `minikube config view` command to display the current configuration.

```bash
minikube config view
```

This will show the configuration for memory and CPU if you have set them previously using the `minikube config set` command.

### 3. **Check CPU and Memory Allocation of the Running Minikube VM:**
You can check the allocated resources (memory and CPU) for the running Minikube virtual machine by using:

#### **On Linux/Mac with Docker as a driver:**

```bash
docker inspect minikube | grep -E '"Memory":|"NanoCpus":'
```

This will display the memory (in bytes) and CPU settings (in nanoseconds) of the Minikube Docker container.

#### **On Linux/Mac/Windows with VirtualBox as a driver:**
If you're using VirtualBox as the driver, use the following command to check the VM details:

```bash
VBoxManage showvminfo minikube | grep -E 'Memory size|CPU count'
```

This will show the memory size (in MB) and CPU count allocated to the Minikube VM.

### 4. **Use kubectl to Check Resource Limits of Minikube Components:**
To see CPU and memory resource limits for Minikube system components, you can use `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl top nodes
```

This shows the current CPU and memory usage on the Minikube node (as well as other nodes if any are available).

Alternatively, to check resource usage for pods:

```bash
kubectl top pod -A
```

This command shows the CPU and memory usage of all the pods across all namespaces.

### 5. **Inspect with `minikube ssh` (if necessary):**
If needed, you can SSH into the Minikube virtual machine and run typical Linux commands like `free -h` to check memory usage or `nproc` to see the CPU count:

```bash
minikube ssh
```

Once inside the Minikube VM, run:
- To check memory:
  ```bash
  free -h
  ```
- To check CPU count:
  ```bash
  nproc
  ```
