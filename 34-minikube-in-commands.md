After logging into the Minikube VM using `minikube ssh`, you can perform various operations with commands you can apply in the virtual machine. These operations are useful for managing the virtual machine (Linux-based) that Minikube runs on, monitoring system resources, and debugging.

Here are some basic commands you can run inside and what they do:

### 1. **Checking System Information**
- **To see the number of CPUs**: 
  ```bash
  nproc
  ```
  Shows the number of processors assigned to the virtual machine.
  
- **To see memory (RAM) usage**:
  ```bash
  free -h
  ```
  Shows the total, used, and free memory (RAM) of the system.

- **To check disk usage**:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
  Shows the usage status of disk partitions and remaining free space.

### 2. **Network and Internet Connection**
- **To see the IP address**:
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```
  Lists the IP addresses of the virtual machine's network interfaces.

- **Connection test (Ping)**:
  ```bash
  ping 8.8.8.8
  ```
  Tests whether the virtual machine has an internet connection.

### 3. **Checking Kubernetes Pods and Services**
Since Minikube runs the Kubernetes node in a VM, you can also use `kubectl` commands inside the Minikube VM:

- **To list pods**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```

- **To list services**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc --all-namespaces
  ```

### 4. **Monitoring System Performance**
- **To monitor CPU and memory usage live**:
  ```bash
  top
  ```
  Shows running processes, CPU and memory usage in real-time.

### 5. **Examining Log Files**
You can access log files to get information about Kubernetes and other system services.

- **To view system logs**:
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/syslog
  ```
  You can read system logs.

- **To view Kubernetes logs**:
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/kubelet.log
  ```

### 6. **Package Management and Application Installation**
The virtual machine is usually a small Linux distribution (e.g., Alpine). Therefore, you can install or remove software using the package management system. However, these operations may be limited as the virtual machine is typically lightweight and temporary.

- **Updating installed packages (If package manager is available)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```

### 7. **File Management**
- **To see folder and file structure**:
  ```bash
  ls -lah
  ```
  Shows detailed folder contents.

- **To create a folder**:
  ```bash
  mkdir <folder_name>
  ```

- **To view file contents**:
  ```bash
  cat <file_name>
  ```

### 8. **Restarting Services**
You can control and restart Kubernetes and other system services inside the Minikube VM.

- **Restarting Kubernetes node**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart kubelet
  ```

- **Restarting Docker (If Minikube is using Docker)**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart docker
  ```

### 9. **Connection Test Between Pods**
- **To ping a pod**:
  ```bash
  ping <pod_ip_address>
  ```
  You can test if pods can access each other.

### 10. **Checking Kubernetes Cluster Status**
- **To check Kubernetes node status**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
  Lists the status of Kubernetes nodes.

### Notes:
- The virtual machine may be temporary, so some changes you make may be lost when the Minikube virtual machine is restarted.
- Some commands and operations may require sudo privileges.

These commands allow you to perform various system management and Kubernetes management operations inside the Minikube virtual machine.
