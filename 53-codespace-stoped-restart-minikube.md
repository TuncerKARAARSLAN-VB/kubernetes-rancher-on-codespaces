If you've taken a break and come back to see that your Codespace has stopped, hereâ€™s how to resolve the issue step by step:

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Refresh the Page:**
   - First, refresh the Codespace page to check if the issue is resolved after the stop.
   
2. **Restart Minikube:**
   - To ensure a stable environment, run the following commands to stop and restart Minikube:
     ```bash
     minikube stop
     minikube start
     ```

3. **Check for Deleted Docker Images:**
   - Since the public image you pushed to Docker Hub (`docker.io`) was deleted, you will need to push it again.

4. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
   - Go to the working directory where your `my-python-app` project is located:
     ```bash
     cd my-python-app
     ```

5. **Rebuild Your Docker Image:**
   - Compile and build your image again:
     ```bash
     docker build -t my-python-app .
     ```

6. **Tag the Image for Docker Hub:**
   - Tag the Docker image using your Docker Hub username and the name of the app:
     ```bash
     docker tag my-python-app docker.io/tuncerkaraarslan/my-python-app:latest
     ```

    ```
    docker push docker.io/tuncerkaraarslan/my-python-app:latest
    ```

    ```
    kubectl set image deployment/my-python-app my-python-app=docker.io docker.io/tuncerkaraarslan/my-python-app:latest
    ```

7. **Push the Image to Docker Hub:**
   
   - Docker Hub re login:
    ```
    docker logout
    docker login docker.login
    ```
    
    Create a Kubernetes secret for Docker registry credentials:
    ```
   kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
    --docker-username=tuncerkaraarslan \
    --docker-password=<your-password> \
    --docker-email=tuncer.karaarslan@gmail.com 
    ```
   
   - Push the image to Docker Hub:
     ```bash
     docker push docker.io/tuncerkaraarslan/my-python-app:latest
     ```

8. **Redeploy the Application in Minikube:**
   - Update your Kubernetes deployment with the new image:
     ```bash
     kubectl set image deployment/my-python-app my-python-app=docker.io/tuncerkaraarslan/my-python-app:latest
     ```

9. **Verify the Status:**
   - Ensure that your deployment is running smoothly:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     kubectl get services
     ```

10. **Check Logs if Needed:**
    - If you encounter further issues, check the logs to diagnose:
      ```bash
      kubectl logs deployment/my-python-app
      ```

      ```
      kubectl describe pod <your-pod-name>
      ```

By following these steps, your environment should be restored and the `my-python-app` container should be up and running again in Minikube.
