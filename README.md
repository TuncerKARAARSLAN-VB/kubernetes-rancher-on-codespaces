# kubernetes-rancher-on-codespaces

The aim of this study is to provide a working environment for the rapid delivery of kubernetes trainings. 

Codespace provides us with the docker environment that needs to be installed on the computer. Most of the time, companies are not able to provide these facilities for trainings. Due to high security rules, the necessary environment for the training cannot be provided and the participation of students cannot be ensured. Codespace provides the necessary environment for training in the cloud on github, allowing all students to access and participate in the work from the cloud with their own computers.
