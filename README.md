# kubernetes-rancher-on-codespaces

The aim of this study is to provide a working environment for the rapid delivery of kubernetes trainings. 

Codespace provides us with the docker environment that needs to be installed on the computer. Most of the time, companies are not able to provide these facilities for trainings. Due to high security rules, the necessary environment for the training cannot be provided and the participation of students cannot be ensured. Codespace provides the necessary environment for training in the cloud on github, allowing all students to access and participate in the work from the cloud with their own computers. 

# Traninig Details

The **"Kubernetes: From Zero to Mastery"** training provided to **SBM Turkey (Insurance Information and Monitoring Center)** was a comprehensive and highly interactive program, spanning 12 days. Throughout the course, participants engaged in real-world, hands-on activities that enabled them to learn Kubernetes from the ground up to an advanced level with practical applications.

### Training Content and Scope

**1. Introduction and Core Concepts**
   - **Introduction to Kubernetes:** Understanding Kubernetes' role in container orchestration, its architecture, and key components.
   - **Containerization and Docker:** How Kubernetes integrates with Docker, container management, and Docker fundamentals.
   - **Kubernetes Installation:** Setting up Kubernetes clusters locally (Minikube) and on cloud providers.

**2. Kubernetes Components**
   - **Pods, Nodes, and Deployments:** Basics of application deployment and multi-container architectures.
   - **Namespaces and Labeling:** Managing resource isolation for different teams and projects using labels and namespaces.
   - **ReplicaSets and Scaling:** Workload scaling and automatic scaling of applications.

**3. Networking and Service Management**
   - **Kubernetes Networking Model:** Communication between containers, networking plugins, and service mesh architecture.
   - **Services and Load Balancing:** Managing services in Kubernetes, load balancing, and DNS solutions.
   - **Ingress Controllers:** Configuring external access to Kubernetes applications via ingress resources and reverse proxies.

**4. Persistent Storage and Volume Management**
   - **Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC):** Managing persistent data outside containers and integrating various storage solutions.
   - **Stateful Applications:** Running stateful applications on Kubernetes, handling data management, and backup strategies.

**5. Kubernetes Security**
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implementing authorization policies and managing user-based access control.
   - **Network Policies:** Managing traffic and enhancing security at the Pod level.
   - **Secrets and ConfigMaps:** Safely managing sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) and configurations.

**6. Advanced Topics**
   - **Helm Charts for Package Management:** Simplifying Kubernetes application deployments with Helm, including creating custom charts.
   - **Custom Resource Definitions (CRD):** Extending and customizing Kubernetes using CRDs and operators for self-healing capabilities.
   - **CI/CD on Kubernetes:** Automating pipelines and integrating with tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI.

**7. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting**
   - **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:** Tracking performance, collecting metrics, and visualizing cluster health.
   - **Log Management with the ELK Stack:** Managing logs using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
   - **Alerting with Alertmanager:** Proactive monitoring with automated alert systems.

**8. Application Scaling with Kubernetes**
   - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** Automatically scaling applications based on demand.
   - **Cluster Autoscaler:** Dynamically adjusting cluster size to meet resource demands.
   - **Canary and Blue-Green Deployments:** Safely updating applications with minimal risk using deployment strategies.

### Training Approach

This training focused on **hands-on practice** and interactive learning. Each session was designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts with practical, real-world scenarios, allowing participants to apply their knowledge immediately. **Interactive discussions** and daily projects helped solidify understanding and build valuable practical experience.

### Key Outcomes

Through this training, SBM Turkey gained the following competencies:
- Mastering **container orchestration** with Kubernetes for **high availability** and **scalability**.
- Applying advanced **security** and **performance optimizations** in Kubernetes cluster management.
- Seamlessly integrating Kubernetes into **DevOps workflows**.
- Utilizing Kubernetes in microservices architecture for agile and easily managed infrastructure.

By the end of the training, the SBM Turkey teams were well-equipped to implement Kubernetes in their enterprise projects efficiently, preparing their technology infrastructure for the future.

I would like to thank all the participants who collaborated on the project for their support during the training.
